## Goal

Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed using a convolutional neural network. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Extra: Create a Dog Classifier Flask app.
