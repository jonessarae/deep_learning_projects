## Goal

Build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed using a convolutional neural network. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Data

I downloaded and unzipped the dog and human datasets provided by Udacity. 

The dog dataset was placed in my project's home directory at the location /dog_images, and the human dataset was placed at location /lfw.

There were 8351 dog images and 13233 human images.
